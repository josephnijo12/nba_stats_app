### [Checkout my NBA PICK YOUR FAVOURTITE PLAYER APP](https://nba-stats-app.onrender.com)
ABOUT
This project is an App the allows users to add their favourite nba player, with their carrer stats and the amount of Championship. Furthermore, it allows the user to delele and edit the nba players stats and app. The user can also add comments and then view them.

## Planning and problem solving
There was problems along the way, one problem I ran into was an error, that didn't allow me to access the webpage. This was very minute error and it was due, to the table in the db not being set up right. This took the most time to fix as the error wasn't showing up anywhere and in my mind I did set up the tables right. This was fixed by adding the table again. Another issue that I faced was with my comments, when the comments button was clicked it would say method not found. This was the second hardest to fix, as it was my first time working with comments. I after reading the code mutiple times, I figured out the route that was going didnt have the correct the method which is posting. Furthemore, there were small bugs to fix such as when points where edited it by the user it show null. This was due to indications error.

## Cool tech 
The programming languages I used where python and flask. CSS was also used, to style the webpage. I used MVC as the layout method for my app, so it's easier navigate and makes changes in the code.
## Bugs to fix 
There werent any major bugs inside my app, the only bug I would fix would be the fact the the deloyment on render is working to standard. Furthmore, some images on my map weren't cropped correctely and it caused the head of the althletes to be out of the frame. 
## Lessons learnt
One lesson I have learnt to do is always check for the minor details, such as spelling and the order in which the code is written. Another lesson I leart name id differently and not use plurals of them. 

## Future Features
Somethings I would like to add in the future would be to have a background music playing the background. Furthermore, I would liked to add a fuction that would have let user compare two sets of data from players and who ever had the higher average it would highligh that particular stat red.
